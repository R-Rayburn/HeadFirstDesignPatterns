## Chapter 1

### Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.

### Principles to know
- Encapsulate what varies
    - If there are different values, move it out into its own instance.
- Favor composition over inheritance
    - has-a can be better than is-a
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
    - Pros for this is that testing is easier, and it prevents brittle code

### Other things we learned from this chapter:
- Knowing the OO basics does not make you a good OO designer.
- Good OO designs are reusable, extensible, and maintainable.
- Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.
- Patterns are proven object-oriented experience.
- Patterns donâ€™t give you code, they give you general solutions to design
  problems. You apply them to your specific application.
- Patterns are not invented, they are discovered.
- Most patterns and principles address issues of change in software.
- Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all
  other parts.
- We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.
- Patterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your
  communication with other developers.
