### State Pattern

### Principles to know

### Bullet Points

Q: Which of the following describe the state of our implementation?
- [x] This code certainly isn’t adhering to the Open Closed Principle.
- [x] This code would make a FORTRAN programmer proud.
- [x] This design isn’t even very object-oriented.
- [x] State transitions aren’t explicit; they are buried in the middle of a bunch of conditional statements.
- [x] We haven’t encapsulated anything that varies here.
- [x] Further additions are likely to cause bugs in working code.
